This repository provides the Python implementation of our work on cell segmentation in 3D microscopy images using a cascaded deep learning architecture proposed in the paper[1]. The cascaded architecture consists of two deep learning networks: an image regression network and a voxel-wise classification network. First, the image regression network estimates two Euclidean distance maps, including an enhanced cell-interior map and a border map. Next, the difference of these two maps is fed as input to the voxel-wise classification network, which outputs a semantic segmentation mask. Finally, an instance-wise mask is provided by utilizing the outputs of the two networks in a classical seeded watershed approach.
